## Features

- Works seamlessly with the Bootstrap Package for TYPO3
- Should work fine with any Bootstrap 4 driven theme
- Creates a portfolio sortable by categories
- Includes 5 different list layouts
- Optionally each item in the list can have a different layout
- Project details are loaded into a modal window with Ajax
- Optionally projects can have a "real" details page with a URL

## How does it work?

- Install the extension via Extension Manager or Composer
- Create a folder and some project records and categories
- Put all categories you want to use for the showcase in a parent category
- Create a page with the Plugin "Showcase Portfolio List"
- Create an extension template record on this page (or use your root template!)
- Include the static template for Showcase on your template record

## ToDo

- update translations
- add Bootstrap 5 templates
- fix bugs, a lot of bugs...
