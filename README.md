# Showcase / Portfolio Extension for TYPO3

This extension provides a showcase/portfolio with categorized projects and various layout options. Each project contains a title, a teaser, a main text, and any number of links and media files like images, videos or audio. This can be used to create portfolios for a freelancer or an advertising agency, for example.

**Note:** The extension is based on **Bootstrap 4** and was created with the Bootstrap Package for TYPO3. Currently **NO CSS** for other frameworks or standalone versions is integrated. But this is in progress. Also please note that it's in **alpha** state, so be careful with testing in live environments.
